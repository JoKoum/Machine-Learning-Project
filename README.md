## Predict users product reviews sentiment
---
#### Semester project for the Machine Learning class of the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr/) by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus

The project evaluates the performance of different Machine Learning Classification algorithms over predicting the correct sentiment (Positive or Negative) of the given review in **Greek** language.

The [Amazon Cell Phones Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews) reviews CSV file from Kaggle was the initial dataset. After preprocessing and translating the data, more files were created.

- Used datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-WGObbkfur67vylKkT7mdXsxOMB7czOx?usp=sharing). You can load them directly via the notebook as well.

Trained model is tested against actual product reviews taken from [Skroutz](https://www.skroutz.gr) 

##### You can clone the project from repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/JoKoum/Machine-Learning-Project.git
     
##### You can use create a new conda environment using the requirements.txt file:

    conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
